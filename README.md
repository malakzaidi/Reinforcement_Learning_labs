## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**, guided by **rewards**. Unlike supervised learning, RL relies on trial-and-error exploration to discover optimal strategies.

### Core Concepts
- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.
- **State (\( s \))**: A snapshot of the environment.
- **Action (\( a \))**: A decision made by the agent.
- **Reward (\( r \))**: Feedback from the environment (positive or negative).
- **Policy (\( \pi \))**: A strategy mapping states to actions.
- **Value Function**: Estimates long-term reward.
- **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))**: Balances immediate vs. future rewards (0 ≤ \( \gamma \) < 1).

### The RL Loop
1. Observe state \( s_t \).
2. Select action \( a_t \) using policy \( \pi \).
3. Receive reward \( r_{t+1} \) and next state \( s_{t+1} \).
4. Update knowledge based on feedback.
5. Repeat until mastery or task completion.

### Challenges in RL
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balancing trying new actions vs. leveraging known good ones.
- **Sparse Rewards**: Learning from infrequent feedback.
- **Credit Assignment**: Linking delayed rewards to past actions.
- **Scalability**: Managing large state/action spaces.

This repo tackles these challenges with implementations ranging from simple to sophisticated RL methods.

## 📋 Q-Learning: The Classic Approach

### How Q-Learning Works
Q-Learning is a **model-free**, **value-based** RL algorithm that learns the optimal **Q-function**, \( Q(s, a) \), representing the expected cumulative reward for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \) and following the optimal policy thereafter. It uses a **Q-table** to store these values.

#### Update Rule
The Q-value is updated using the **Bellman equation**:
\[
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]
\]
- \( \alpha \): Learning rate.
- \( r_{t+1} \): Immediate reward.
- \( \gamma \): Discount factor.
- \( \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') \): Best future Q-value.

#### Exploration
An **\(\epsilon\)-greedy** policy balances exploration and exploitation:
- Probability \( \epsilon \): Random action.
- Probability \( 1 - \epsilon \): Best action per Q-table.

### Q-Learning Implementation
In this repo, see `q_learning/gridworld.py` for a tabular Q-Learning example:
- **Environment**: A 5x5 grid with a goal and obstacles.
- **Goal**: Learn a path to the goal while maximizing reward.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  def update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state):
      best_next_q = np.max(q_table[next_state])
      q_table[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * best_next_q - q_table[state, action])
  ```

**Limitations**: Q-Learning excels in small, discrete spaces but struggles with large or continuous domains—enter Deep Q-Learning.

## 🌌 Deep Q-Learning (DQN): Scaling Up

### DQN Innovations
**Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, pioneered by DeepMind, replaces the Q-table with a **neural network** to approximate \( Q(s, a; \theta) \), where \( \theta \) are the network parameters. It scales to complex tasks like Atari games.

#### Key Features
1. **Experience Replay**:
   - Store transitions (\( s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1} \)) in a buffer.
   - Sample random batches for training, reducing correlation.
2. **Target Network**:
   - A separate network \( Q(s, a; \theta^-) \) computes stable targets.
   - Synced periodically with the main network.
3. **Loss Function**:
   - Minimize:
     \[
     L(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a'; \theta^-) - Q(s_t, a_t; \theta) \right)^2 \right]
     \]

### Neural Networks in DQN
- **Architecture**: CNNs for image inputs (e.g., Atari) or dense layers for vectors.
- **Input**: State (e.g., 84x84x4 frame stack).
- **Output**: Q-values for each action.
- **Training**: Backpropagation with Adam optimizer.

### TensorFlow Implementation
See `dqn/atari_dqn.py` for a full DQN implementation:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Q-Network
def build_q_network(input_shape, num_actions):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 8, strides=4, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 4, strides=2, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, strides=1, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_actions, activation='linear')
    ])
    return model

# Training step
def train_dqn(states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values = q_network(states)
        q_action = tf.reduce_sum(q_values * actions, axis=1)
        next_q_values = target_network(next_states)
        targets = rewards + gamma * tf.reduce_max(next_q_values, axis=1) * (1 - dones)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.MSE(targets, q_action)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, q_network.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, q_network.trainable_variables))
```
