## 📋 Overview

This advanced reinforcement learning framework provides researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a robust platform for implementing, experimenting with, and visualizing state-of-the-art RL algorithms across diverse environments. The framework is specifically designed to balance flexibility with ease of use, making it suitable for both educational purposes and serious research applications.

At its core, the framework implements three fundamental reinforcement learning paradigms:

## 🔬 Algorithm Deep Dive

### Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state:

$$Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha [r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t)]$$

Our implementation features:
- 🎯 Epsilon-greedy action selection with adaptive decay
- 📈 Dynamic learning rate adjustment
- 📊 Real-time Q-value tracking and visualization
- 🔄 Efficient updates for large state spaces

### SARSA

SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy temporal difference learning algorithm:

$$Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha [r_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)]$$

Key implementation highlights:
- 🧮 On-policy updates reflecting actual agent behavior
- ⚖️ Balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- 🛡️ More conservative policy than Q-Learning
- 📊 Comprehensive performance metrics

### DQN (Deep Q-Network)

DQN extends Q-learning by using neural networks to approximate the Q-function:

```python
self.dqn_model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_dim, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, self.action_space)
)
```

Advanced features include:
- 🧠 Two-layer neural network architecture
- 🔄 Experience replay buffer to reduce sample correlation
- 🎯 Target network for stability
- 📊 Batch learning with optimized tensor operations

## 📊 Visualization Capabilities

## 🔍 Example Results & Analysis

### Taxi-v3 Environment

Our implementation achieves near-optimal performance on the Taxi-v3 environment:

- ✅ **Average Reward**: ~8.5-9.5 after 5000 episodes
- ⏱️ **Average Steps**: ~13-15 steps per episode (optimal is ~12)
- 🔄 **Convergence**: Typically within 3000-4000 episodes

The policy visualization (Image 1) demonstrates efficient path planning with the agent learning to take direct routes between pickup and dropoff locations while avoiding unnecessary actions.

### Algorithm Comparison

When comparing the three implemented algorithms on Taxi-v3:

1. **Q-Learning** 🥇
   - Highest final performance (avg reward: -56.13)
   - Fastest convergence rate
   - Most sample-efficient for discrete environments

2. **SARSA** 🥈
   - Slightly lower performance (avg reward: -60.98)
   - More stable learning trajectory
   - Safer policies in stochastic environments

3. **DQN** 🥉
   - Comparable final performance (avg reward: -58.96)
   - Requires more samples to converge
   - Better suited for environments with complex state spaces

### Learning Dynamics

The training progress (Image 3) reveals characteristic reinforcement learning behavior:
- Initial steep learning phase with dramatic improvement
- Intermediate plateau where the agent refines its policy
- Final convergence with diminishing returns on additional training
